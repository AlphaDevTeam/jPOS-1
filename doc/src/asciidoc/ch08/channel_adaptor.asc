== ChannelAdaptor

When jPOS acts as client from a TCP/IP standpoint, you most likely use
the +ChannelAdaptor+ service to manage the low level socket connection.

The +ChannelAdaptor+ uses the Space to communicate with other jPOS
components, basically through two _Space queues_, one for *input*
and the other one for *output*.
