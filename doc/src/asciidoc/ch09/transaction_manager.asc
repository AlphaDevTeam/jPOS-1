== TransactionManager

The +TransactionManager+ is a jPOS Service that monitors a Space queue waiting
for transactions to be processed. These transactions are expected to be
+Serializable+ objects, but they are in most jPOS applications actually an
+org.jpos.transaction.Context+ object.

The following image shows a typical scenario:

* A QServer (or a QMUX) receives a message and delegate its handling to an +ISORequestListener+
  implementation
* The +ISORequestListener+ creates an instance of a +Context+, puts there some information relevant
  to the transaction (such as a reference to the received +ISOMsg+ and the originating +ISOSource+)
  and place it in a well known space, using a well known +key+. We use the space as a _queue_
  so we call it _queue_, but it's just a regular entry in the space under a well known name.
* The +TransactionManager+ picks the entry from the space (using a regular +in+ operation) 
  and runs the previously described two-phase commit protocol on the configured participants.
