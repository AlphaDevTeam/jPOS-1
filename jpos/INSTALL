Starting at release 1.2 jPOS drops GNUmake support and builds 
using Ant (http://jakarta.apache.org).

We currently distribute 2 modules: 'main' and 'ext'.

While 'main' module's classes are self contained, 'ext' module
requires external classes (to be installed at jpos/ext directory,
see ext/README)

Running build (bin/build on Unix, build.bat on Windows) will show
the available targets:

Examples:

   bin/build main javadoc : builds main and javadoc on a Windows machine
   bin/build ext doc : builds main, ext, extdoc and doc

(Windows users should chdir to jPOS's home directory and execute
 start bin/build)

This is work in progress, feel free to ask. Join our user's
