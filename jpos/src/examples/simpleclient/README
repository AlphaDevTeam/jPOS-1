simpleclient creates an ISOChannel and sends/receives a couple of
ISOMsgs; we are demonstrating here how to create and use an ISOChannel,
but you'll surely find ISOMUX (upcoming example) of great use on
client side.

In order to try this example you'll have to run simpleserver on
the same machine (or change <jpos>/src/etc/jpos.cfg 'simpleclient.host'
property to point to the desired host).

Have a look at <jpos>/src/etc/jpos.cfg file in order to 
find out the properties involved.

Although not needed, simpleclient demonstrate the use of
Sequencer (we are using VolatileSequencer here, have a look
at the ext module [<jpos>/src/ext/org/jpos/core/ReliableSequencer]
for a reliable diskbased one).
